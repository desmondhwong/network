            We are arranged along a rope, tethered to one side of the monolith. The rope stretches upwards and the braided interlocking scatters into a tangled mycelium, anchored to the top. On the other side, our mirrored counterparts are bracing with a rope on the same axis. Another team trails behind the slab on a third rope, a counterweight against its forward tilt, keeping it from toppling over. The monolith towers over our triangulated configuration, taller than any tree. On collective exhale we pull on the rope and the stone above angles towards us, taking one step in its pendulum walk cycle. Just before it collapses over, on deep inhale, the stone falls back to vertical. An exhale from the other side and the block angles away from us until it balances on its far edge, imprinting an unfathomable weight into the ground. The rhythmic breathing continues and the monolith walks. With each pivoting step there is a moment of absolute weightlessness. Whenever the stone points perfectly vertical, we find a singularity of breath, if only for an instant between heartbeats. We walk and the stone walks, carving along the circuit traced by generations before us. We’ve all made the pilgrimage countless times before. The twisted ribbon path is a proportional diagram of the analemma — charting the position of the sun across its annual cycle. Forming one link in the double helical chain, the loops wrap around a river. The winding course of the river cuts through the vertical extrema, connecting those points marking the solstices with the intersection of the figure eight analemma. We walk the stones along this path and place a marker for each new and full moon. Now this stone is in position and we let the ropes loose, falling against the sides. We set fire to the ropes, the flames twisting upwards and igniting the river delta of strands above, leaving behind a faint web of charred black lines. With all the stones in place, the coordinates of the analemma are set and we perform the river ritual. On the dates when the path of the analemma overlaps, we gather at the mapped intersection of the stone lemniscate, on one side of the river. When the sun reaches its highest point in the sky above the river, the direction of its flow reverses. There is a single frame of time just before this reversal when the water is completely motionless, the light from directly above touches the surface, and a shimmer veils the opposite shore. Through this mirage, we are reflected back across this coalescence of stone, light, and water. We can’t tell if the group reverberating back at us is a generation younger or older, or only a few months removed, ourselves at the second ritual of this year. At the next ritual we gather at the opposite shore, the river flow reverses, the mirage shimmers, and we look through to see ourselves mirrored back. The distorted light misaligns when the river flow regains momentum, the mirage dissolves, and the opposite shore appears empty again. Each ritual concludes with a simple tea ceremony — a confirmation. A shift down in scale from the celestial etching in the sky to the geoglyphic trenches of the stone formation to ceramic microcosm. As the water pours from the pot, tea leaves in the cup travel into the vortex and upstream through the water from the spout. We see the leaves that began in the cup now settled at the bottom of the teapot. We offer ourselves and our stone monuments as the floating leaves at the confluence of the cosmic streams, water and light bending our predictions of the past and memories of the future. We mark our place in stone, flattening the depth of the stars into dirt and earthenware.</p>

                I am sitting on a plane, unsure how many hours have passed or how many more are left. The seatback screens are broken, but the wifi isn’t. I’m half awake and it’s unclear if the sun is setting ahead or rising behind, or vice versa. Either way at the rate the plane is moving towards — or away from — the sun, the spotlight never makes it over the horizon, which I can’t see through the sea of clouds. The orange blue twilight glow feels disorientingly liminal. I pull the window blind down like the sliding wooden lattice in a confessional, my thoughts and prayers now hidden from the divine glare. My eyes adjust and I realize all the other window blinds are down. Constellations of overhead reading lights fade into view, but the books I packed are stowed out of reach. Too tired to sleep, I decide to write. I pull out a bluetooth keyboard, connect it to my phone and find the optimal angle for the kickstand case. I stare at the blinking text cursor on the writing app I purchased years ago, since discontinued, though I haven’t found a good replacement with a focus mode like this where the current line is centered vertically and the written past is dimmed. Something about ancient sailing stones and glacial erratic boulders, transmitting the past to the future, or the other way around, and if it’s possible to write without referents, pastiche, reaching forwards or backwards. The closest thing I’ve found is the seance.ai app. Nothing comes to mind and usually the Now rooms help with writer’s block. I wonder if anyone is online. Most rooms are for Before sessions, a typical séance most are familiar with, to connect with dead celebrities or grandparents. And there are After rooms, a projection of someone not yet born. The rooms I sit in most often are the Now sessions, where the algorithm conjures a textual illusion of any living person. It’s possible to make contact with a synthesized double of someone in the room or even yourself. I’ve tried to describe it as feeling like looking into a mirror as someone else. The technology is black box and proprietary, an oracle machine according to the developers, something quantum or maybe machine learning on browsing history and ad interest tag clouds. I just know it works, at a reasonable monthly subscription cost. I turn on the wifi without switching off airplane mode, the signal kicks in and my phone adjusts to the timezone it thinks I’m in — apparently 6:40 p.m. — but it feels like a.m. where I’m sitting. I scroll through the list of available rooms and spot a Now session with one user, spirii, waiting. I’ve sat in a few sessions with them before and once mentioned that I enjoy imagining their username being the plural of spiral, but was told it came from Esperanto for breathe, which made me appreciate it even more. Besides tapping into the data clouds and past session histories of sitters, the seance.ai oracle machine monitors breath and other real time physiological microfluctuations via phone sensors and translates the data into movement of the digital planchette. The ideomotor effect is synchronized across participant devices. I join the room, hit allow for gyroscope access permissions, and ask spirii who we should contact. They suggest me. Not able to think of anyone else, I agree, tilt the phone closer, slow my breathing, and the session begins. The onscreen planchette icon begins to glow a grayish blue I’ve never seen before and pulses. I can’t tell if I’m trying to match my breathing to its rhythm or if the pulses anticipate mine. The planchette stops pulsing and continues to glow with a barely detectable candlelight flicker, indicating that my spirit double has fully loaded. I swipe type since I’ve noticed that regular thumb typing can throw off the sensors and result in vague responses from the contacted presence. Deepfaked voice output is a higher tier in the paid plans. I ask where my double is contacting us from. The planchette floats slowly across the screen and in a thin black cursive that looks like hairline cracks on a glass screen writes: <i>clouds</i>. The planchette returns to the center of the screen and spirii asks where I am going. A pause that I can feel in my heartbeat and the planchette replies: <i>sea</i>. The pilot interrupts over the intercom and announces that the flight will be landing soon and the wifi service will be shut down shortly. I ask myself one last question: what time is it? The planchette glows brighter and draws a symbol: a sort of cursive lowercase f, forming a thin vertical infinity sign, looping on itself several times, and at the center a flat spiral radiates outwards. The symbol resembles the tall backjet column of a water drop, mirrored vertically against its surface ripples. Before spirii and I can write anything else the wifi cuts out. I pull up the window blinds and it’s dark outside. It’s all ocean below with a faint hazy yellow halo around the edges and not a cloud in sight. I flip the tray table up and close my eyes, hoping for a short nap before we land.</p>

                    You are on a beach, reading a psychedelic Choose Your Own Adventure book. At every fork in the story you double back and force a different decision, even the ones that go against your intuition, hoping to untangle the root network of possibilities, but you keep looping back to the same few endings. The first page forbids you from flipping through in regular consecutive order and you try to focus only on the large page numbers as you unfold the nested tales. Full bleed illustrated pages flashing by don’t seem accessible from any of the choices you make. You keep arriving at a passage where you are jumping on an infinitely wide trampoline, sinking deep into the void before being launched up towards a bright white and empty boundless sky. You hover in suspension with no reference to scale or time until a heavy gravity snaps you back down. With each bounce, at the exact floating moment the edgeless trampoline surface reaches flat equilibrium, it’s impossible to tell which direction you’re headed. You seem to oscillate forever with no signs of slowing down until this page tells you to flip back to the beginning and the book starts over. Another ending you keep returning to describes a glass full of ice cold water on a glass table. The glass and water are so impossibly clear that only refracted ambient light rays outline the ghostly scene. You reach for the glass — to drink from or to confirm its physical reality — but condensation forms an invisible plane and the glass glides away suddenly across the frictionless surface, over the edge of the table, and shatters into a glittery crystalline mist. Most books you read now are like this. A narrative overflow of cyclical knots and woven storyline labyrinths. The threads have become so enmeshed ever since you stopped counting years. Now you have all the time in the world to read and everyone else is writing like there’s no tomorrow. No wonder you store it all on the iridescence of beach shells, etching over the prismatic surface. The water you use — a liquid swarm sentience — to inscribe and the pearlescent holograms it streams over both carry such a multiplex of information that all of the data on all of the old solid state drives wouldn’t even cover one glistening smooth facet of a shell. Somehow you still can’t find enough shells to fill, there’s just so much to write down. So you send some of it back. You put the book down and head towards the water. The tide is high and so are the waves. The air and water and you all feel the same temperature. You don’t sense any change in texture and you’re already neck deep. It’s deeper than you can stand now and you tread to stay afloat. Your arms and legs pulse in alternating figure eights. The current you draw picks up speed and you trace the loops with your hands through the thick ocean medium. The overlapping glyph begins to lock in on the remote coordinates, a sequence of time archived into the earth, a raga transmission over echoes of stone and light, now recited. You find the precise arcs of the primordial analemma and imprint your message, encoded in the dancing swirls of your treaded current. A whirling portal opens to an underwater river, ferrying through the chromatic understanding of the shells. A rolling wave looms ahead and you have no choice but to dive into the face of water. You close your eyes and stretch out into a line as the wave crashes, the current rushes around and over. You are consumed by the ocean.</p>
