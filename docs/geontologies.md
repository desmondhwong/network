As we become increasingly captured by the competing claims of precarious natures and entangled existences, a wild proliferation of new conceptual models, figures, and tactics is displacing the conceptual figures and tactics of the biopolitical and necropolitical. For the purpose of analytical explication, I cluster this proliferation around three figures: the Desert, the Animist, and the Virus.

The Desert, the Animist, and the Virus are tools, symptoms, figures, and diagnostics of this mode of late liberal governance, perhaps most clearly apparent in settler late liberalism than elsewhere, they might need to be displaced by other figures in other places if these other figures seem more apparent or relevant to governance in these spaces.

#### The Desert
*"The Desert holds on to the distinction between Life and Nonlife and dramatizes the possibility that Life is always at threat from the creeping, desiccating sands of Nonlife."*

The Desert represents spaces perceived as devoid of life, highlighting the constant threat to life from the encroachment of lifelessness. It embodies the possibility that life can be restored with proper management and technological intervention.

- **Imaginary of Carbon:** Represents the Desert's central concept, emphasizing the distinction between Life and Nonlife.
- **Motivation for Life Search:** Drives the search for extraterrestrial life and technologies for terraforming planets.
- **Fear of Desolation:** Fuels fears of a dystopian future like in "Mad Max."
- **Fossil Fuel Dynamics:** Fossils, once full of life, now fuel modern industries and potential mass extinction.
- **Cultural Works:** Reflected in theoretical, scientific, and artistic works like "Mad Max" films, Philip K. Dick’s "Martian Time-Slip," and Juliana Spahr’s "Well Then There Now."

#### The Animist
*"The Animist insists that the difference between Life and Nonlife is not a problem because all forms of existence have within them a vital animating, affecting force."*

The Animist figure insists that all forms of existence have a vital, animating force, challenging the distinction between Life and Nonlife by recognizing the vitality in all entities.

- **Imaginary of the Indigene:** Represents populations with an inherent Animist insight, including pre-Christian, pre-Islamic, and settler colony populations.
- **Cognitive Subjects:** Includes alternative cognitive perspectives like those of Temple Grandin.
- **Artistic Explorations:** Explored in works like Laline Paul’s "The Bees" and the film "Le Quattro Volte."
- **Vital Materialism:** Philosophical approaches inspired by thinkers like Spinoza and Peirce, challenging the hierarchy of life by distributing agency across human and nonhuman materials.

---

#### The Virus
*"The Virus seeks to disrupt the current arrangements of Life and Nonlife by claiming that it is a difference that makes no difference."*

The Virus disrupts the arrangements of Life and Nonlife, operating outside these divisions to extend itself by exploiting and confusing the boundaries between Life and Nonlife.

- **Imaginary of the Terrorist:** Represents the errant radicalization potential of the Virus.
- **Climate Change Population Control:** Suggests the need to address human population size.
- **Ecological Agents:** Examples include Ebola, waste dumps, drug-resistant bacteria in factory farms, and nuclear power.
- **Zombie Figure:** Symbolizes the transformation of Life to Nonlife, creating a new species war.
- **Post-9/11 Crises:** Associated with fundamentalist Islam, radical Green movements, and critical thoughts on biosecurity.
- **Environmental Activism:** Borders between activists and terrorists, highlighting geo-security and climate change impacts.

These figures—Desert, Animist, and Virus—serve as conceptual tools to explore the architectures of geontological governance and the mode of late liberal governance that they diagnose and reflect.
